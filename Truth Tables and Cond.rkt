Assignment 5 - Truth Tables and Cond
Submit on Google Classroom by the end of class.

If a question asks you to make a function,
it must follow the complete design recipe
including a purpose statement, signature
and appropriate tests to recieve full credit
|#

; Question 1
; Complete the following truth table:
#|
---------------------
| P | Q | (and P Q) |
| #t| #t|     #t    |
| #t| #f|     #f    |
| #f| #t|     #f    |
| #f| #f|     #f    |
---------------------
|#

; Question 2
; Complete the following truth table:

#|
-------------------------------------
| P | Q | (not P) | (and (not P) Q)) |
| #t| #t|    #f   |        #f        |
| #t| #f|    #f   |        #f        |
| #f| #t|    #t   |        #t        |
| #f| #f|    #t   |        #f        |
--------------------------------------
|#

; Question 3
; Complete the following truth table:

#|
--------------------------------------------------------
| P | Q | (and P Q) | (not P) | (or (not P) (and P Q)) |
| #t| #t|     #t    |    #f   |            #t          |
| #t| #f|     #f    |    #f   |            #f          |        
| #f| #t|     #f    |    #t   |            #t          |       
| #f| #f|     #f    |    #t   |            #t          |

#| Question 5:
Make a function called "num-cond" that takes in 2 numbers.
If the first number is bigger, subtract the two numbers.
If the second number is bigger, multiply the two numbers.
If they are the same number, simply return that number.
|#
; Purpose statemant: This is ment to determen if both would be greater or equal to eachother
; if num1 is greater it subtracts both numbers, if num2 was greater it would return the product
; if they were equal it would just return the number.

;Signature: Number Number -> Number

(define (num-cond num1 num2)
  (cond
    [(> num1 num2) (- num1 num2)]
    [(< num1 num2) (* num1 num2)]
    [else num1]))

(check-expect (num-cond 15 8) 7)
(check-expect (num-cond 6 9) 54)
(check-expect (num-cond 10 10) 10)

#| Question 6:
Make a function called "super-cond" that takes in 3 numbers.
If all three numbers are negative, return 0
If the first two numbers are negative, return 1
If the first and third numbers are negative, return 2.
If the second and third numbers are negative, return 3.
If all of the numbers are positive, return the product of all 3 numbers.
|#
; Purpose Statement: This is ment to if any of the three numbers are negative
; and depending on which are negative it would return 0, 1, 2, or 3
; if they are all positive they will all mutiplie and return the prouduct.

;Signature: Number Number Number -> Number

(define (super-cond num1 num2 num3)
  (cond
    [(and  (< num1 0) (< num2 0) (< num3 0)) 0]
    [(and  (< num1 0) (< num2 0) (>= num3 0)) 1]
    [(and  (< num1 0) (>= num2 0) (< num3 0)) 2]
    [(and  (>= num1 0) (< num2 0) (< num3 0)) 3]
    [(and  (> num1 0) (> num2 0) (> num3 0)) (* (* num1 num2) num3)]))
    
(check-expect (super-cond -1 -2 -3) 0)
(check-expect (super-cond -1 -2 3) 1)
(check-expect (super-cond -1 2 -3) 2)
(check-expect (super-cond 1 -2 -3) 3)
(check-expect (super-cond 10 2 3) 60)

#| Bonus Question:
Make a function called "vowel-check" that takes in 1 string.
If the function contains a vowel, return the first vowel the string contains.
If the function contains no vowels, return "No Vowels".

For example,
(vowel-check "airplane") -> "a"
(vowel-check "bear") -> "e"
(vowel-check "xyz") -> "No Vowels"
